Deep-Learning-CNNs-in-Tensorflow-with-GPUs

With this model forked from "TensorBoard-TF-Dev-Summit-Tutorial-master" I learned the architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN), how to create a CNN in Tensorflow, and provided predictions on labels of images. Also, I learned how to run the model on a GPU so as to spend my time creating better models and not waiting for them to converge.
